# Phone Directory
 Contacts Management - We are going to implement the concept of hashing, hash table here by making a "Phone Directory" program that takes input which includes the user's name and their phone number and saves the data in the hash table.  The hash table will use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the correct value can be found
